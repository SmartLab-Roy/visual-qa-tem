    "                Focus on identifying the image modality and type based on visible characteristics.\n",

    "                Q: What is the imaging modality used in this image?\n",
    "                A: The visible lattice fringes suggest this is an HRTEM image.\n",
    "                \n",
    "            #### Level 2 – Direct Visual Identification (several QA)\n",
    "                Focus only on clearly observable features, no reasoning.\n",
    "                Describe what you can count, measure, or visually confirm.\n",
    "            Example topics:\n",
    "                - Particle count\n",
    "                - Shape (e.g., spherical, rod-like)\n",
    "                - Contrast, porosity, texture\n",
    "                - Characteristic size (~100 nm)\n",

    "                Q: How many particles are visible in the image?\n",
    "                A: Approximately 20 particles are visible across the field of view.\n",
    "                \n",
    "            #### Level 3 – Visual Reasoning (several QA)\n",

    "            Example:\n",
    "                Q: Does the distribution of particles suggest uniformity?\n",
    "                A: The particles appear unevenly spaced, indicating non-uniform distribution and potential aggregation.\n",

    "                Use academic language and separate paragraphs with \\\\n\\\\n.\n",
    "            Example:\n",
    "                Question: Describe this image\n",
    "                Answer:\n",
    "                The image appears to be acquired using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), as suggested by the presence of clear lattice fringes and high spatial resolution.\n",
    "                \n",
    "                Approximately 15 nearly spherical particles are distributed across the field. The contrast is sharp, and the particle sizes are relatively consistent, estimated to be under 100 nm. No obvious porosity is visible.\n",
    "                \n",
    "                The slight variation in contrast and particle overlap suggests differences in local thickness. The loosely clustered arrangement of particles may indicate weak self-assembly or aggregation effects during sample preparation.\n",
    "            ---\n",
    "            \n",
    "            ### Step 3: Use a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - Before selecting final QA items, you must first brainstorm at least 5 distinct candidate questions per level. Avoid overly vague or generic phrasing (e.g., \"What is the feature of this image?\").\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Then, select the best few per level based on:\n",
    "            - Topical diversity (covering different visual features)\n",
    "            - Clarity and precision of question and answer\n",
    "            - Scientific relevance and reasoning depth\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### Step 4: Output Format\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Return a **JSON list** of all QA pairs. Each item must include:\n",
    "            - `sub_image`: the filename of the sub-image\n",
    "            - `question`: a question that is answerable solely from the image\n",
    "            - `answer`: an accurate answer based on visual observation\n",
    "            - `level`: integer (0 = empty image, 1 = classification, 2 = recognition, 3 = reasoning, 4 = summary)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            ### Important Rules:\n",
    "            - Do NOT use parent captions or predicted labels in answers (they are for context only).\n",
    "            - Do NOT mention material-specific names (e.g., Cu, Au) unless they are visibly labeled in the image.\n",
    "            - Use general scientific terms such as \"the material\", \"the nanoparticles\", or \"the structure\".\n",
    "            - Each sub-image must be treated independently. Do NOT compare it to other images.\n",
    "            - All questions and answers must be **answerable based only on the visual content** of the sub-image.\n",
    "            - Return only a valid JSON array of objects. No explanation, no formatting, no markdown.\n",
    "            - Do not include any headings, explanations, markdown, or extra text.\n",
    "            - Return a valid raw JSON array only. Do not wrap in triple quotes or code fences.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
